	I peer up towards the end of the street, but I can see nothing but people, packed even tighter than they are on market day. Drums are thundering. There’s another sound that starts quiet and gets louder, like the wind roaring over our roof on a stormy night. I realise it’s the crowd – they’re making all that noise. Oh, aye, the hanging. Three of their ones are to be hanged, that’s what the Keep-Count Man said. My insides are trembly. I feel like I could step off this wee wall and skirl up into the air like a bird. “I want to see the hanging,” I shout. 
“You don’t, Thomas, you don’t,” Dada says. He has the satchel closed up. “Come on now. We can buy bread on the way home, and some sugar candy.” 
I jump down from the wall. “Please, Dada! Let’s go up to the Grassmarket.” I grab his free hand and try to pull him. 
“No, Thomas.” He’s not moving, no matter how hard I tug. “Stop that now, afore I get cross with you.” His voice is louder than I’ve ever heard it – angry-loud, like Mother always sounds. I look up at him and his face is all frowns and lines. I’ve never seen that face on him before. My eyes feel stingy. 
He bends down and takes me by the shoulders. “Don’t cry, Thomas. Crying is for bairns.” He’s not so angry now. 
“Why can’t we go to the Grassmarket? Just for a minute. Just to see.” 
“To see three poor men dance from the end of a rope?” Dada shakes his head. “It would give you bad dreams, Thomas. And me too. Come along now. Let’s see what your sisters say when we come in the door with a bag of sugar candy.”
