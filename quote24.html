	As I get closer to the university my chest tightens. I pray silently, calling upon the Lion of Judah to walk by my side. The Faculty of Divinity is housed in a ramshackle building that was once a merchant’s house, until he died and bequeathed it to the college. Some say he did it as much to spite his family as to glorify God. The courtyard in front of it is crowded with students and here I cannot pretend that I am not being remarked upon. I see nudges, pointing fingers, heads leaning together to share whispered words. In the hope of blocking them out, I pray. Lion of Judah, Lion of Judah... 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	I reach the sanctuary of the faculty. The hallway is blessedly empty, although I can hear a murmur of conversation from the common room. My fellow scholars will be gathered around the fire, warming themselves before facing the chill of the lecture hall. I hesitate at the door for a moment, and before I can lay my fingers on the handle it is pulled open and John Row, the regent, barges into me. We both leap back, I uttering an apology, although our collision was not my fault. He glares at me.

	Patrick springs up. “I cannae do it. I won’t speak against him.” He tries the door but finds it locked, and he looks around wildly. “When they bring me in I’ll refuse to say a word.”

	<p class="shadow text1">
	I have a vague memory of some quip of Thomas’s about Mungo’s parsimonious landlord. “Plookie Rab”, Thomas called him. “It must be a convenient spot. So close to the university.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
“Indeed. Doubly so since he keeps a bookshop too.” 
“So that is what he has hiding behind the curtain,” I say. And then, before I can prevent myself, “I have never been in a bookshop.” 
“But you are... I rather got the impression–” Mungo stops, conflicting emotions warring on his face. Confidence and inferiority, overfamiliarity and deference. 
I take pity on him. “I am a great reader, and am fortunate always to have had books about me. My husband consults me when he is making purchases for our library at home.” 
“And yet you have never been in a bookshop,” Mungo says. He looks pensive for a moment. “I would be honoured to escort you into this one. It is quite respectable, I believe.” 
I acquiesce, and allow him to open the door for me. It is warped, and scrapes on the floorboards with a sound that makes me shudder. The shop is no more than a small front room, but it is lined with closely packed bookshelves with cupboards beneath them. There are two trestle tables placed a little apart from each other in the centre of the room. One has several books laid open upon it, while the other displays samples of paper, pens and inkwells. A man comes through from the back of the house. Hutchison, I presume. He is taller than most men, and wearing an ancient velvet coat that is a little too short for him. There is a raised sore on his upper lip, the size and colour of a copper bawbee. It draws my eye, and he reachs up to touch it, as if self-conscious of my scrutiny. 
“I see before me something outside my usual run of customer,” he says, attempting a bow. “And may I say, it makes a pleasant change.” There is something false in the way he speaks – not simply his laboured gallantry, but in the very tone of his voice. He is like a common actor attempting to mimic the accents of a gentleman. 
“This is Mistress Carruth,” Mungo says. “Wife to Dr Robert Carruth.” 
Hutchison strokes his chin and makes a display of giving this information some thought. “Dr Robert Carruth, Dr Robert Carruth...” He shakes his head and looks mournful. “I fear the good doctor does not favour this establishment with his custom, for I do not know the name.” 
“You will have to make do with me in his stead,” I say, looking around me and drinking in the promise of so many books. 
“Alas, we have very little that might interest the ladies,” says Hutchison. “No poetry, nor romances, no no, that is not our stock in trade at all. The young men, you see–” and here he gestures at Mungo, “prefer to read more serious works. Natural philosophy, divinity, that sort of thing.” 
“I have very little interest in romances,” I say, “although my children like such tales.” 
“Children, eh?” Hutchison brightens. “You don’t want to fill their heads with too much nonsense. I believe I have something more improving here.” He bends to open one of the cupboards and pulls out a small book. “Here we are,” he says, and hands it to me.

	<p class="shadow text1">
The woman gives a curt nod, but closes the door in our faces nonetheless. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
“What do we do now?” I look up and down the street. One gentleman is walking past on the other side. He stares at us. I feel my face heat. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
“She’ll be back, you wait and see.” Thomas walks to the corner where a wynd runs down the side of the house. “As I recall his consulting room was towards the back of the house. I’m away to have a keek through the window.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
Patrick and I exchange a glance. He looks as fearful as I feel. “Have a bit of wit, Thomas,” I call after him as he skites down the wynd. “They’ll have the town watch on us if they catch you snooping.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
Thomas ignores me and stands on tiptoe looking in through the window. “He has a wall-full of books,” he says. “How would you like to have so many volumes, Mungo?” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
The front door opens again just as Thomas scrambles back up the wynd. The servant woman nods us in.
