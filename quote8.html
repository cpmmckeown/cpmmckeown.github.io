	The reading rooms of the university’s medical library are bright with the natural daylight flooding in through the tall windows, but it is a different matter among the bookshelves. Each aisle is like a dim cloister, kept dark and dry the better to preserve the books. I avail myself of one of the library lanterns and search the shelves reserved for the newest medical publications. At last I find the book I am seeking:
	
	<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bTJAAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dissertatio%20Epistolaris%20ad%20spectatissimum%20doctissimumq%20virum%2C%20by%20Thomas%20Sydenham&pg=PR3#v=onepage&q=Dissertatio%20Epistolaris%20ad%20spectatissimum%20doctissimumq%20virum,%20by%20Thomas%20Sydenham&f=false" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: none" > the most recent volume from Thomas Sydenham </a> 
	
	It is a slim book, for which I am thankful. There is no time to spare in finding a treatment for Jonet. I have come here directly from my visit to that wretch Aikenhead, pausing only to send a brief note to Mistress Dundas telling her the cause of Jonet’s illness. Now I take the book from the shelf, find an empty desk in the reading room, and apply myself to Sydenham’s clear accounts of the symptoms and treatments for the most novel afflictions torturing the population.

	Dada laughs again, and that seems to make Dr Carruth sterner still, so Dada stops laughing and says, “Well, it is a little combination of my own devising called a pastille espagnole.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“A pastille? You mean something like a… sweetie?”  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Aye, they’re not unlike sweeties, but not as… sweet.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Mr Aikenhead, my young patient lies dangerously ill. She is in the grip of a dry fever, and her private regions are afflicted with the most ferocious blistering I have ever encountered. Is there a chance that these pastilles of yours might have been the cause of her condition?” 
	</p>

	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Oh, dear, dear, dear…” Dada’s all of a fluster. He turns to the shelves of jars and bottles and hokes around, clinking them all together so hard he’ll crack them. Then he lifts out a wee shiny jar with a big, wide cork for a stopper. He opens it and holds it out to Dr Carruth.
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	The doctor leans over to inspect the contents, but jumps back straight away. “Dear God,” he says, and pulls a handkerchief from his pocket to cover his nose and mouth. “The stench of it is foul.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Aye, it’s sharp, right enough,” says Dada, “but it’s beautiful to look at, don’t you think? See how it gleams.” He tilts the jar, and I stand on tippy-toes so as to see inside it. It’s full of dull brown powder, but when Dada rocks the jar from side to side the powder shifts and changes colour. One moment it’s green, the next gold, the next brown again. A magic powder. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“What in the name of heaven is it?” says Dr Carruth.
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“You’re not familiar with it, Doctor?” Dada smiles. I smile too, because Dada knows something that Dr Carruth disnae. “Crushed blister beetle,” Dada says. “Known to some as the Spanish fly.”
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	Dr Carruth goes all pink in the face. “You make and sell such… aids to concupiscence?” he says. That’s a new word for me. I’ve not heard it before. Concups… I can’t say it, even inside my head.
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“There’s many a respectable married couple have need of it, and there’s no sin in matrimonial delight, is there, Doctor?”
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	Dr Carruth opens his mouth, but no words come out. His face goes all red. “And what need has an innocent young girl, scarcely sixteen years of age, of such an item?” he says. His minister’s voice has gone ever so quiet, but he’s all a tremble as if he’s angry.
