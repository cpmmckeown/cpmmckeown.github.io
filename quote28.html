	Katharine’s lodgings are on the fourth floor of a tall tenement. It is a middling sort of place, for while I am nearly knocked to one side by an ill-fed barefoot child hurtling down the stairs – his mother’s cries of abuse echoing after him down the stairwell – I also find my progress across the fourth floor landing observed by a respectable-looking widow woman peering out of her door. It is, therefore, like so many Edinburgh tenements: a place the poor might aspire to, and the genteel descend to.

	“You’re a bit late in the day to be looking for work,” he says.  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	I feel affronted that he takes me for one such as the men I passed. I straighten my stance and adjust the buttons on my coat, to draw his attention to my respectable attire. “You mistake my purpose, sir. I am a student from the university, in search of nothing more than a breath of sea air.”  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	He inspects me again. “Aye, right enough,” he says. “You’ve a dockman’s shoulders but a scholar’s hands. No good to me.”  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“How is trade?” I ask, remembering this is a favoured subject for those who worked the Shore.  
	</p>

	<p class="shadow text1">
	He shakes his head. “Poor enough. The only goods we send out into the world are wool and soldiers. There’s always a market for soldiers, but little enough demand for good Scottish wool these days.” He takes a pipe from his coat and pats his pockets in search – I presume – of tobacco. Finding none he replaces the pipe.  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	For a brief moment I entertain the idea of joining one of the regiments, but dismiss it at once. Without money or friends to secure me a commission I would have to be a common soldier, and I could not endure that. “When will these boats sail?” I ask, looking over at them.  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“On the evening tide. The Anne Maria and the Whiffler are bound for Hull, and the Minora for Flanders. Are you after a passage?”  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“No, no, I asked only to make conversation.”  
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Aye. If you’ll take my advice, a young man such as yourself should set his sights on America. They’ve got towns as big as Edinburgh now.”  
	</p>

	<p class="shadow text1">
“She’ll be back, you wait and see.” Thomas walks to the corner where a wynd runs down the side of the house. “As I recall his consulting room was towards the back of the house. I’m away to have a keek through the window.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
Patrick and I exchange a glance. He looks as fearful as I feel. “Have a bit of wit, Thomas,” I call after him as he skites down the wynd. “They’ll have the town watch on us if they catch you snooping.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
Thomas ignores me and stands on tiptoe looking in through the window. “He has a wall-full of books,” he says. “How would you like to have so many volumes, Mungo?” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
The front door opens again just as Thomas scrambles back up the wynd. The servant woman nods us in.
