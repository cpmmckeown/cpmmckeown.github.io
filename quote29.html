The binding is unfamiliar. I turn to the title page: <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N07112.0001.001/1:1?rgn=div1;view=fulltext" style="color:red;font-family:arial;text-decoration:none;"> A Relation of the Fearful Estate of Francis Spira </a>
	</p>

<p class="shadow text1">
A vague memory stirs. Yes, I remember the tale – an old one, about the wickedness of the Roman Church. Spira had been compelled to recant his Protestantism, and in the process had lost all faith and died in despair. ...When I first turned its pages my faith was strong and I had pitied poor Francis Spira as his own belief fell away. But now I wonder if even then some seed was planted that came to fruition these last few months. The very idea that religious faith could die – I had probably never considered it before first reading this book. Did it work in the same manner on Thomas? He had only been a child when it came into his possession. Even with his precocious talent, it would have been beyond him, would it not? I do not know. I can be sure of nothing.
