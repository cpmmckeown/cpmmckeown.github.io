<h1>
Breaking Materiality: Agential Realism and Playing <i>Flappy Bird</i> in <i>Super Mario World</i>
</h1>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
In this presentation I want to argue that a radical new method of reading Videogames has the potential to bring to light their potential to change how we engage with ontological issues. This talk takes a rigidly anti-representational perspective, discounting familiar notions of dichotomy between a phenomenal/noumenal real. I regard the idea of 'things' as less important than an understanding of performance, suggesting that objects can be understood as the outcome of phenomena. As such, when I discuss 'a videogame' I want to make clear, I am discussing the performance of playing videogames. My point of view relies on a combination of social constructivist theory and quantum physics following the philosophy of Karen Barad.

<h2>
Seth Bling's Code Injection
</h2>

<p>
As expressed in the video, Seth Bling, a hacker/coder was able to - with the help of several others - develop a method for hijacking the videogame Super Mario World, in such a way that the 'code' of the game could be rewritten in real time. As Bling discusses, he was able to do this by manipulating specific glitches, enabling the inputting of code. What this brings to light are certain assumptions our society currently rests on with relation to the materiality of computer operations and the notion of 'computer code' in general.
</p>

<p>
To put it as simply as possible, there is a general tendency within our society to engage with computers at a so-called 'high-level'. This 'high-level' refers to manipulating groups of computer instructions through simple inputs. Although we may press a single 'print' button on our wordprocessor program, in reality this instantiates millions of computer instructions.
</p>

<p>
It is important for us to understand a little bit more of what 'code' actually 'is' before we proceed. In essence, 'code' are groups of electonic volts. This is not essential, of course, our current computer processing, functioning on a basic level using binary logic, could be enacted with anything that can represent the on/off binary states. However, the reality of our current computing paradigm is that binary 1's and 0's represent high and low voltages, differing in level depending on the processor used within the individual machine.
</p>

<p>
It is tempting, when we start to think of computer code as 'something' to overly 'materialise' computer operations. We may think of computer code as groups of solid, tangible entities, being passed from place to plce within a tangible machine. To an extent, this is accurate but it also overlooks the complexity of our observable reality. And it is this complexity that allowed Seth Bling to instigate his code injection. I want to provide a brief overview of some of the range of enagements surrounding the materiality of code. The objective of this is to argue that discussing the notion that code is either 'material' or 'immaterial' is to miss a much more impactful point - computer code which is so tempting to consider something either akin to magic or else akin to notes in a diary are active, lively operations. Overlooking this, we miss that computer operation reveals the inherent lack of object-based materiality of our world.
</p>
<h2>
The Dialogue Surrounding Software's Materiality
</h2>
<p>
There is a continuing discourse surrounding code materiality with powerful voices on either side.
</p>
<h2>
How this applies to the Code Injection
</h2>

<h2>
Code from a New Materialist Perspective
</h2>
<p>
We can gauge this appreciation for nonhumans from Seth Bling's phrasing within the video.
He claims, "A little over a year ago I became the first person to complete a Super Mario World 'Credits Warp' on the Super Nintedo console".
In itself this give us no cause for consideration. 'Person' can suggest many things and has, for decades, been employed as a gender-neutral substitute for gendered nouns.
However, Bling goes on to say, "Yesterday, I became the first human to do something much crazier on console".
His change from 'person' to 'human' here is telling of his acknowledgement of machines being able to achieve this feat with relative ease.
</p>


<h2>
How an Agential Realist Perspective Changes Everything
</h2>

<p>
Barad's work postulates a posthuman performative account of reality, bringing together aspects of Foucault and Butler's social constructivist theories and aspects of quantum physics.
Barad suggests that reality is quite literally constructed through performance - that entities do not pre-exist phenomena, but that entities are only ever the apparent products of phenomena, constantly being reformed.
In the same manner Butler suggests a social construct such as gender is constantly reshaped through an interplay between societal factors and individual activities, Barad suggests the same idea holds true for materiality.
Though she doesn't state it explicitly, Barad's methodology relies on how counter-intuitive the idea that actions can exist before entities seems to a western reader.
</p>

<p>
She takes great pains to illustrate, using ideas from the physical sciences, that this idea can be witnessed at a fundamental level.
To take just one example, Barad discusses the famous 'two-slit experiment' and its conclusion that sub-atomic particles can behave as both particle and wave, determined by their inter-activity with the measuring apparatus.
Viewed one way, one result is shown. Viewed another way, another.
At a fundamental level, materiality is a performance; an active, multiple production that produces what seems to be.
Digging deeper into quantum physics, this seems increasingly the case.
It is worth noting, therefore, that Barad uses the term 'intra-action' rather than 'interaction' to suggest the productive phenomena that produces apparent objects from potentiality, rather than an engagement between objects.
</p>
<p>
As noted in my introduction, Barad's ideas are often difficult to step out in a precise, relatable manner because, so often, the properties of quantum particles can be overlooked in everyday occurances.
Though colour, taste, and sound are all reminders of the quantum weirdness of our world, those aspects are easy to overlook because they are so familiar.
Turning our gaze to Seth Bling and his code injection, therefore, we can sieze on an example, distant enough from our everyday comprehension and with enough engagement with the quantum aspects of reality that Barad's observations jump to the fore.
