Breaking Materiality: Agential Realism and Playing <i>Flappy Bird</i> in <i>Super Mario World</i>
</h1>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
In this presentation I want to argue that Videogames have the potential to bring to life aspects of Karen Barad's agential realist philosophy that are otherwise difficult to discuss. 

</p>



<h2>
Seth Bling's Code Injection
</h2>

Hello
</p>


<h2>
The Dialogue Surrounding Software's Materiality
</h2>

<h2>
How this applies to the Code Injection
</h2>

<h2>
Code from a New Materialist Perspective
</h2>
<p>
We can gauge this appreciation for nonhumans from Seth Bling's phrasing within the video.
He claims, "A little over a year ago I became the first person to complete a Super Mario World 'Credits Warp' on the Super Nintedo console". 
In itself this give us no cause for consideration. 'Person' can suggest many things and has, for decades, been employed as a gender-neutral substitute for gendered nouns.
However, Bling goes on to say, "Yesterday, I became the first human to do something much crazier on console". 
His change from 'person' to 'human' here is telling of his acknowledgement of machines being able to achieve this feat with relative ease. 
</p>


<h2>
How an Agential Realist Perspective Changes Everything
</h2>

<p>
Barad's work postulates a posthuman performative account of reality, bringing together aspects of Foucault and Butler's social constructivist theories and aspects of quantum physics. 
Barad suggests that reality is quite literally constructed through performance - that entities do not pre-exist phenomena, but that entities are only ever the apparent products of phenomena, constantly being reformed. 
In the same manner Butler suggests a social construct such as gender is constantly reshaped through an interplay between societal factors and individual activities, Barad suggests the same idea holds true for materiality.
Though she doesn't state it explicitly, Barad's methodology relies on how counter-intuitive the idea that actions can exist before entities seems to a western reader.
She takes great pains to illustrate, using ideas from the physical sciences, that this idea can be witnessed at a fundamental level.
To take just one example, Barad discusses the famous 'two-slit experiment' and its conclusion that sub-atomic particles can behave as both particle and wave, determined by their inter-activity with the measuring apparatus. 
Viewed one way, one result is shown. Viewed another way, another.
At a fundamental level, materiality is a performance; an active, multiple production that produces what seems to be. 
Digging deeper into quantum physics, this seems increasingly the case.
It is worth noting, therefore, that Barad uses the term 'intra-action' rather than 'interaction' to suggest the productive phenomena that produces apparent objects from potentiality, rather than an engagement between objects. 
</p>
<p>
As noted in my introduction, Barad's ideas are often difficult to step out in a precise, relatable manner because, so often, the properties of quantum particles can be overlooked in everyday occurances.
Though colour, taste, and sound are all reminders of the quantum weirdness of our world, those aspects are easy to overlook because they are so familiar. 
Turning our gaze to Seth Bling and his code injection, therefore, we can sieze on an example, distant enough from our everyday comprehension and with enough engagement with the quantum aspects of reality that Barad's observations jump to the fore.
