<h1>
Breaking Materiality: Agential Realism and Playing <i>Flappy Bird</i> in <i>Super Mario World</i>
</h1>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
In this presentation I want to argue that a radical new method of reading Videogames has the potential to bring to light their potential to change how we engage with ontological issues. This talk takes a rigidly anti-representational perspective, discounting familiar notions of dichotomy between a phenomenal/noumenal real. I regard the idea of 'things' as less important than an understanding of performance, suggesting that objects can be understood as the outcome of phenomena. As such, when I discuss 'a videogame' I want to make clear, I am discussing the performance of playing videogames. My point of view relies on a combination of social constructivist theory and quantum physics following the philosophy of Karen Barad.

<h2>
Seth Bling's Code Injection
</h2>

<p>
As expressed in the video, Seth Bling, a hacker/coder was able to - with the help of several others - develop a method for hijacking the videogame Super Mario World, in such a way that the 'code' of the game could be rewritten in real time. As Bling discusses, he was able to do this by manipulating specific glitches, enabling the inputting of code. What this brings to light are certain assumptions our society currently rests on with relation to the materiality of computer operations and the notion of 'computer code' in general.
</p>

<h2>
The Dialogue Surrounding Software's Materiality and How it Applies to The Code Injection
</h2>

<p>
I want to discuss the code injection from the perspective of the discourse surrounding the materiality and immateriality of code. There is a continuing discourse surrounding code materiality with powerful voices on either side. First, I want to discuss the perspective that views code as 'immaterial', ethereal or, as it is popularly termed, 'vaporous'. This discourse is somewhat out of fashion of late but it is essential to the main point I want to make here.
</p>

<p>
To put it as simply as possible, viewing code as 'vaporous' engages with a general tendency within our society to not understand computers at a basic, functional level. This is compacted by our tendency to use computers at a so-called 'high-level'. This 'high-level' refers to manipulating groups of computer instructions through simple inputs. Although we may press a single 'print' button on our wordprocessor program, in reality this instantiates millions of computer instructions.
</p>

<p>
Keeping the Code Injection in mind, Super Mario World is a game that I would hope most of us are familiar with. Most of us may remember how we play the game, pressing a series of inputs using the 12-button Super Nintendo controller to defeat a series of challenges from pit-traps to anthropomorphic mushrooms and turtles. But how many of us have ever considered what is occurring at an electronic level when we play the game and to what extent does it matter?
</p>

<p>
Wendy Hui Kyong Chun remains, to a large part, the most popular proponent of the vaporous understanding of technology. In a number of articles in the 2010's she took a stance, defending 'vapour theory' which, at that time, was losing momentum within media studies.
</p>
<h3>
 "Vaporiness is not accidental, but rather essential to new media and more broadly to software. Software afterall is ephemeral information is ghostly and new media projects that have never or barely materialised are among the most valorised and cited"
</h3>
<h4>
(2008, Chun, 'On Sourcery or Code as Fetish', p. 301. )
</h4>
<p>
She asserts that software exists but at the same time, does not. We know that code is there, we can see it, we write it, it is copied to disks and held in storage. In the case of a SNES cartridge, certain elements of the game process is available to be manipulated on the board itself through techniques like circuit bending (Cory Archangel). However, this seems to account for so little of what occurs in the moments of interacting with the technology and playing the game. Software, as we may or may not know, lives an in-between existence, always being translated between different operation languages, more and less readable to humans. The extent to which we can say it exists may be limited.  More recent work in a similar vein (Federica Fabretti; David M Berry) continue this dialogue in a familiar way.
</p>

<p>
In the context of the code injection, Seth Bling highlights the vaporousness of code through his ability to engage with it in ways that were not predicted by the programmers. His ability to input commands through conventional means, using standard controllers, not introducing any foreign elements, draws our attention to how the 'code' is not a single, stable entity but can rather be considered vapourous.
</p>

<p>
On the flip side of this is the vocal counterpoint, headed up by well known media theorist such as Friedrich Kittler, Alexander Galloway, Wolfgang Ernst and Geert Lovink. For these scholars, disputing the materiality of code is an act of callousness, ignoring its impact upon society or else ignoring its nonhuman but nevertheless valid existence. Kittler, for one, desired for us to become more aware of the levels of obfuscation that occur through the use of high-level programming languages. He attempts to call us back to an awareness of the materiality of code.
</p>

<h3>
" Silicon hardware obeys many of the requisites for such highly connected, non-programmable systems. Between its millions of transistor cells, some million to the power of two interactions take place already; there is electronic diffusion, there is quantum mechanical tunnelling all over the chip."
</h3>

<p>
To take such assertions seriously is important for us to understand a little bit more of what 'code' actually 'is', from the perspective of computer science, before we proceed. In essence, 'code' are groups of electonic volts. This is not essential, of course, our current computer processing, functioning on a basic level using binary logic, could be enacted with anything that can represent the on/off binary states. However, the reality of our current computing paradigm is that binary 1's and 0's represent high and low voltages, differing in level depending on the processor used within the individual machine.
</p>

<p>
With regards the code injection, we can begin to unravel the vapourous magic of Bling's actions. Although we may think in the terms of 'the game' shifting from one thing to another in front of our eyes, from another, more hardware focused perspective, we can trace the individual charges, perhaps down to the electron, as they are stored in magnetic memory, flow through copper wiring or are passed through silicon chips. Each of the power up stages he collects, for instance, Bling recognises that new voltages are being transferred to distinct physical locations within the onboard memory of the SNES and the onboard memory of the cartridge.
</p>

<p>
It is tempting, when confronted with more 'hard scientific' opinions to begin to think of computer code as 'some thing'. To overly 'materialise' computer operations. We may think of computer code as groups of solid, tangible entities, like pebbles, being passed from place to plce within a tangible machine. To an extent, this is accurate but it also overlooks the complexity of our observable reality. In Kittler's words, our current silicon dependent technology is not completely predictable. It engages with processes such as quantum tunnelling that add a level of negligible uncertainty to operations.  While we can be drawn in to considering code as material, it is a form of materiality that strikes against our common sense ideas of solidity. And it is this precisely this complexity that allowed Seth Bling to instigate his code injection. To argue that code is either 'material' or 'immaterial' is to miss a much more impactful point - computer code which is so tempting to consider something either akin to magic or else akin to handfuls of pebbles, are active, lively operations. Overlooking this, we miss that computer operation reveals the inherent lack of object-based materiality of our world.
</p>

<h2>
Code from a New Materialist Perspective
</h2>
<p>
Of course, there are alternative ways to read this, to engage more fully with the uncertainty of the materiality in which we find ourselves.
</p>
<h3>
The electrical power grid offers a good example of an assemblage. It is a material cluster of charged parts that have indeed affiliated, raminaing in sufficient promximity and coordination to produce distinctive effects. The elements of the assemblage work together, although their coordination does not rise to the level of an organism.
</h3>
<h4>
2010, Jane Bennett, Vibrant Materiality, p.24
</h4>
<p>
We can gauge this appreciation for nonhumans from Seth Bling's phrasing within the video.
He claims, "A little over a year ago I became the first person to complete a Super Mario World 'Credits Warp' on the Super Nintedo console".
In itself this give us no cause for consideration. 'Person' can suggest many things and has, for decades, been employed as a gender-neutral substitute for gendered nouns.
However, Bling goes on to say, "Yesterday, I became the first human to do something much crazier on console".
His change from 'person' to 'human' here is telling of his acknowledgement of machines being able to achieve this feat with relative ease.
</p>


<h2>
How an Agential Realist Perspective Changes Everything
</h2>

<p>
Barad's work postulates a posthuman performative account of reality, bringing together aspects of Foucault and Butler's social constructivist theories and aspects of quantum physics.
Barad suggests that reality is quite literally constructed through performance - that entities do not pre-exist phenomena, but that entities are only ever the apparent products of phenomena, constantly being reformed.
In the same manner Butler suggests a social construct such as gender is constantly reshaped through an interplay between societal factors and individual activities, Barad suggests the same idea holds true for materiality.
Though she doesn't state it explicitly, Barad's methodology relies on how counter-intuitive the idea that actions can exist before entities seems to a western reader.
</p>

<p>
She takes great pains to illustrate, using ideas from the physical sciences, that this idea can be witnessed at a fundamental level.
To take just one example, Barad discusses the famous 'two-slit experiment' and its conclusion that sub-atomic particles can behave as both particle and wave, determined by their inter-activity with the measuring apparatus.
Viewed one way, one result is shown. Viewed another way, another.
At a fundamental level, materiality is a performance; an active, multiple production that produces what seems to be.
Digging deeper into quantum physics, this seems increasingly the case.
It is worth noting, therefore, that Barad uses the term 'intra-action' rather than 'interaction' to suggest the productive phenomena that produces apparent objects from potentiality, rather than an engagement between objects.
</p>
<p>
As noted in my introduction, Barad's ideas are often difficult to step out in a precise, relatable manner because, so often, the properties of quantum particles can be overlooked in everyday occurances.
Though colour, taste, and sound are all reminders of the quantum weirdness of our world, those aspects are easy to overlook because they are so familiar.
Turning our gaze to Seth Bling and his code injection, therefore, we can sieze on an example, distant enough from our everyday comprehension and with enough engagement with the quantum aspects of reality that Barad's observations jump to the fore.
