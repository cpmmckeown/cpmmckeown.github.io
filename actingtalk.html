Acting: How and Why Would We Talk About It? 
</h1>
<!--There will be Blood-->

<p>
It can be difficult to discuss acting in a 'serious' academic essay. In many ways, however, it's the exact same as discussing any other feature you've discussed so far.
It requires an impressive attention to detail and, as always, a focus on what you can see over what you feel is happening. 
Acting style plays a role in how view a film. It connotes something to us about what we are watching. It is always a feature that we should be willing to analyse
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the milkshake scene. </li>
<li>What is the largest amount of words you could describe the activity with? </li> 
<li>What acting style does Day-Lewis use? </li>
<li>Is this clear to an audience? </li>
<li>Do we believe this character is real? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Personally, I would describe Day-Lewis' performance as larger than life, despite its Strasberg, Stanislavskian heritage.
What does this mean then in the context of the film? 
This is a film about the founding of the sociopathic legacy of America. The acting reflects this inhuman blood lust.
</p>

<h2>
Pantomime
</h2>
<p> 
Of course, some performances are less difficult to guess about but this still plays into the overall message the film is attempting to impart.
Some acting styles over the top, exagerrated, pantomimic. 
Sometimes for comic or other effects.
Always important to ask what that effect is!
</p>
<iframe width="470" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/79i84xYelZI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<ul>
<li>Why did Chaplin exagerrate so much? </li>
<li>Is he compensating for the camera?  </li> 
<li>Is it what his audience expects?</li>
<li>Is this "good" acting? </li>
<li>What is the purpose of acting? </li>
</ul>
<p>
In the context of Chaplin and early cinema, easy argument to make is that acting compensates for poor quality camera/lack of sound/need to express to overcome lack of tools. 
</p>
<p>
In this light, surely we could say Chaplin's Pantomime is 'good' acting because it performs a role, admirably?
</p>
<p>
<i>If Chaplin was trying to make up for camera's limitations, why does Carey do it so many years later? Was it possible that Chaplin just trying to be funny?
His perfectionist nature might seem to say the contrary... </i>

<h2>
Subtlety
</h2>
<p>
Let's talk about the Kuleshov Effect. Do we need an actor to tell us a story, like Chaplin, in cinema - or can montage do all the work?
</p>
<iframe width="470" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gGl3LJ7vHc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<ul>
<li>Again, why THE HELL did Chaplin exagerrate so much? </li>
<li>Why did early Russian film makers think of such a vastly different style of acting?</li> 
<li>What does this mean with regards to time period? It can't be to make up for camera limitations...</li>
<li>Is this "good" acting? </li>
<li>What is the purpose of acting? </li>
</ul>
<p>
At the same time, we continue to use these techniques in contemporary acting. 
</p>

<p>
The main concensus, even in the article, that doing little requires a lot of effort for an actor. Is this true or is it more to do with montage, context and audience?
</p>

<h2>
Reading Acting with the Film Text
</h2>
<p>
Never forget, you should always be reading acting as just one more part of the overall film text. What does the style of acting used say about the overall film and perhaps overall social point being made. 
</p>

<p>
Consider two films with relatively similar acting styles on display.
</p>
<!-- Breathless -->
<iframe width="470" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/peS6ADDysms" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> 
In the context of Goddard: French New Wave; separating from the norm; showing young, punk aeshetics, disdain for conventional filmmaking. Showing a concern with reality and emotion in the wake of the sexual revolution. 
</p>

<!--Computer Chess Mumblecore -->
<iframe width="470" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuGT_L13bQ8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
Here we have a similar acting style on display but radically different meaning. If anything, an attempt to align film with new wave, but only to make a contrary point. These people are not young punks; they are social misfits and outcasts. Mumblecore genre made by intellectually wealthy but cash-poor American's feeling contemporary ennui. This is reflected in their chosen acting style. - And abandoned once the filmmakers got a hit! -
</p>

<h2>
Things to consider!
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Acting style has nothing to do with time period! Varied acting styles always visible!</li>
<li>Acting style is always a part of the overall 'message' of the film, whether textual or metatextual!</li> 
<li>Acting 'styles' are interesting theoretical ideas and interesting to discuss</li>
<li>Acting styles do not always have an impact on the audience</li>
<li>When you write about acting, go into as much detail as you possibly can. Find that detail that supports your argument!</li>
</ul>
