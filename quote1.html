	“Poor lassie,” Dr Irvine says. “The hangman made a widow of her last week.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“What was her husband’s crime?” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“A Covenanter. The usual story. These fellows think they can overthrow the King with no more than a Bible in one hand and a pike in the other.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“And there’s no explanation of why she died so suddenly?” This, after all, is why we are here. “There was no sign of fever or pain?” 
	Dr Irvine fixes me with an odd smile. “Her gaolers report that she was in as good health as one might expect for a girl that had spent the winter in the Tolbooth prison.” 
	He walks to the foot of the table, places a hand on each of the girl’s knees and gently pushes her legs apart. “There’s certainly no sign that labour had commenced. Look for yourself.” 
	I do as he suggests, and examine her perineum for a moment. Dr Irvine’s assessment seems correct. I move back up the table and palpate her belly with my fingers, working thoroughly to study every inch of it. I should be able to feel the dead infant’s skull through her skin, or the jut of his shoulder or knee, but I cannot. His position must be odd, or else he is terribly misshapen. “There seems to be no fluid in her womb,” I say. “Had her waters broken, or did they leak away post-mortem?” 
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Again, it is uncertain. Are you familiar with the Tolbooth prison, Carruth?” 
	</p>

	<p class="shadow text1">
	“Certainly not.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="shadow text1">
	Dr Irvine seems amused, as if by some private joke. “Covenanters are held in the worst of the cells. The floors are thick with filth, and it would take a rare genius to guess if any flux from her formed part of that cess. Her body is the only evidence we have of what befell her.” Dr Irvine turns and lifts the largest scalpel from the side table. “And on that note, shall we see what story her womb tells us?”
