   Third Presentation

	<p>
	Congratulations on your amazing presentations so far. I am looking forward to the next batch (the penultimate presentations). I'd like to give you a little bit of advice with the upcoming presentations. Please make sure your clips work! If you're having trouble, tell me in advance. Also, don't forget that tasks from the questions can be split up between group members! If one person provides the description of a film, a different group member can provide the analysis!
	</p>
	<p>
	In your groups, attempt one of the following questions: 
	</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Using the Sarah Kozloff reading or any reading you prefer, explore three different styles of voice over in cinema. Using any films you wish, define the type of voice over that features in your chosen films and state what impact that has on the film, providing examples. Finally, compare the three styles. </li>
		  <li>Kozloff asks the question, "can we ever believe that an image-maker is less reliable than his creation, the narrator?" (Kozloff p. 115). Using at least three films, explore the tension between voice over and image in cinema. You should focus on a specific shot, sequence or technique when making your argument. </li>
		  <li>Compare the use of voice over in <i> My Life as a Dog </i> with its visual elements, i.e. mise en scene (lighting, camera angles, props, costumes, framing, etc...) and/or editing (pace of cuts, long takes, jump cuts, eyeline matches... etc). How does the voice over serve to emphasise the power of the image? </li>
		<li>Have computer graphics changed the sensory impact of the action sequence? Respond with at examples from at least one film that uses obvious computer enhancement and one film that does not. </li>
			<li>Does <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i> depend on viewers accepting the "Wild Things" as being real for its emotional impact? Provide specific examples from the film. </li>
		
		</ol>
