  Early Digital Cinema

 <p>The presence of the urge to push the limits of the camera tells us one thing: that there will always be a desire to push the limits of what cinema as a medium can achieve. To an extent this runs parallel to the desire to depict realist, psychological drama through cinema, but we do not necessarily need to consider the two as mutually exclusive as I shall discuss later. The techniques brought about by digital cinema simply extend the toolkit for expression within the medium.

<p>It's tempting to talk about Toy story when we discuss digital cinema. However the history of digital cinema extends back far beyond that. We commonly consider films like Whitney's analogue computer cinema or Saul Bass' contribution to Vertigo the first instances of digital cinema. That being said, the urge to extend the range and reach of the camera, the desire to push what is possible, can be traced all the way back to Edison, Melies and later Dziga Vertov. Yet when we examine the use of Bass' introduction we can see that there is more behind this than just a desire to wow an audience. The introduction sequence is an attempt to portray something not easily expressed in a visual medium. To an extent, we can argue that the array of colours and swirls brings us closer to the point of view of James Stewart's character in Vertigo. We have been given an opportunity to live his experience - to a degree.</p>

It is important to consider the impact that digital cinema has had on animation, however. While it may not seem comparable as digital animation has largely superseded analog, there are parallels that can be drawn. The plethora of techniques has been expanded, making films cheaper and faster to produce. The films of Studio Ghibli, for example, were previously all hand drawn. However, rising costs forced the studio to engage with digital techniques. While this increased the studio's output, an argument can be made that something was changed or even lost from this movement to new technology. The company's desire to create Princess Kaguya, a completely hand drawn film, speaks to their existing unease with the change of times. As Ghibli has now closed production we can see how changing techniques have an impact in the cinema landscape.

At the same time we can argue that the move to digital technology has done more than change production cycles and superficial aesthetics. Rather, with the introduction of digital techniques, a greater focus on dystopian themes is evident. The horrific ending sequences of Akira would not have been possible without the use of digital animation. As such, the technology gives rise to its own discourse as we are able to probe the potential of innovation using its own techniques. The same could be said for more overtly digital animated pictures like Appleseed (2004)

<h1>
  Digital Cinema as Expressive Medium
  </h1>  
	<p>
	There are many classic examples of when digital cinema comes into its own and celebrates the techniques and aesthetics that make it unique. Perhaps the most famour example is The Lord of the Rings Trilogy which celebrated its digitally enhanced nature by integrating many impossible things into one combined fantasy world. A famous scene, for example, being the conversation between Gollum and Smeagol, where Andy Serkis, through repeated takes and clever editing, motion capture and a host of other digital techniques, manages to engage in shot-reverse-shot dialogue with himself. Far from this being an attempt to naturalise digital cinema, however, it can be read as passing through a threshold where old Hollywood techniques are instead amplified rather than imitated.

	<p>
	However, as digital cinema has progressed a number of filmmakers have revelled in its capabilities even more. We may think of A Scanner Darkly and its use of Rotoscope technology, or Zack Snyder's 300 or Suckerpunch, for their videogame like aesthetics and controversial depictions of sexuality and violence. However, further afield, through the use of computer technology, foreign cinema has been able to realise new heights of fantasy, previously barred off through budget constraints. In The Mermaid by Stephen Chow, conversations flow in abundance as to the nature of the unknown and the role of ecology in everyday life. This is at once amplified and satirised through the use of digital filming techniques.

	<p>
	Because of its impact on the cost of filmmaking and contemporary cinema aesthetics, digital film making is here to stay. For some, it is already an element of cinema that we should no longer take notice of as distinct and separate but rather as a new extension of an already existing toolkit. Personally, I remain unconvinced of this perspective. I believe there is something distinct about digital imagery that should be celebrated. Attempting, as the directors of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, to create lifelike 3D humans in scenes, is becoming common place. I remain couched comfortably in the 'uncanny valley'. What do you think?
