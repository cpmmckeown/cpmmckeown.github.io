	Digital techniques altered more than just how we could make cartoons faster and easier. They also changed the subject matter.

	The point remains that when digital techniques were introduced to digital cinema, it did more than change the budget of animation, it changed something fundamental on an artistic and expressive level. The same thing is visible is non-animated cinema.

<h1>
  Digital Cinema as Expressive Medium
  </h1>  
	<p>
	There are many classic examples of when digital cinema comes into its own and celebrates the techniques and aesthetics that make it unique. Perhaps the most famour example is The Lord of the Rings Trilogy which celebrated its digitally enhanced nature by integrating many impossible things into one combined fantasy world. A famous scene, for example, being the conversation between Gollum and Smeagol, where Andy Serkis, through repeated takes and clever editing, motion capture and a host of other digital techniques, manages to engage in shot-reverse-shot dialogue with himself. Far from this being an attempt to naturalise digital cinema, however, it can be read as passing through a threshold where old Hollywood techniques are instead amplified rather than imitated.

	<p>
	However, as digital cinema has progressed a number of filmmakers have revelled in its capabilities even more. We may think of A Scanner Darkly and its use of Rotoscope technology, or Zack Snyder's 300 or Suckerpunch, for their videogame like aesthetics and controversial depictions of sexuality and violence. However, further afield, through the use of computer technology, foreign cinema has been able to realise new heights of fantasy, previously barred off through budget constraints. In The Mermaid by Stephen Chow, conversations flow in abundance as to the nature of the unknown and the role of ecology in everyday life. This is at once amplified and satirised through the use of digital filming techniques.

	<p>
	Because of its impact on the cost of filmmaking and contemporary cinema aesthetics, digital film making is here to stay. For some, it is already an element of cinema that we should no longer take notice of as distinct and separate but rather as a new extension of an already existing toolkit. Personally, I remain unconvinced of this perspective. I believe there is something distinct about digital imagery that should be celebrated. Attempting, as the directors of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, to create lifelike 3D humans in scenes, is becoming common place. I remain couched comfortably in the 'uncanny valley'. What do you think?
