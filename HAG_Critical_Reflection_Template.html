		<div> 
		<p> There are several different approaches you could take for the Summative Assessment </p>
		<p> The guidelines from the handbook (slightly edited!) are as follows: </p>
		<ul> 
			<li><h4>1. Critical reflection on the group task (2,000 words) </h4></li>
			
			<li>What story did you tell, and why? </li>
			<li> What relevant scholarship inspired your research?</li>
			<li>How did you go about selecting objects? </li>
			<li>Why did you use that method?</li>
			<li> What objects did you choose? Why? </li> 
			<li> What objects did you leave out? Why? </li>
			<li> What might your biases have been? </li>
			<li> <h4> You will be assessed on your: </h4> </li>
			<li> Argument/explanation of the story your group told about film and television history</li>
			<li> The structure of your writing</li> 
			<li> Your writing style </li> 
			<li> Presentation </li>
		</ul>
		</div> 
		<hr />
		
		<div>
		<p> As with all essays, there is an implicit structure you can, and I think *should* follow here. </p>
		<p> The basic structure behind most academic papers is as follows: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Introduction </li>
			<p>In all papers, introductions should be as short and to the point as possible. In this case you will want to make your <b>thesis statement</b> clear in your introduction. However, as this is a critical reflection on your group project, 
			it is a bit more complicated than usual: You should provide me with an indication of what story you were attempting to tell with your project, i.e. "We were attempting to show how X potentially contributed to constructing feminist narratives 
			in society but its production history was plagued with untold acts of misogyny" - or whatever ground-breaking thesis you have put together, because they are all great! But you must then 
			have some overall opinion about your work and how it progressed. Do you think you covered the ground well? Not well? Make that clear.</p>
			<p> Here is an example of what I'm looking for: </p>
			<p id = "intro"> 
			"Our group presentation discussed the idea that although X potentially contributes to the construction of <b><i> LETS SAY... </b></i> <i>posthuman narratives within society at large,
			its production was plagued with instances of cruelty and exploitation of non-human animals. </i> In this critical reflection, I will explore the extent to which our research project was able to successfully discuss this notion.
			Although our presentation was largely able to cover this broad topic, there is still a lot that we did not cover. This reflective report will first provide a brief overview of the literature that influenced our research, providing
			a context for the research we undertook. Although this will be discussed in more detail below, in short, we found there to be an strong tendency towards viewing X in a positive light, in spite of frequent but marginalised reports 
			to the contrary. We will then discuss the methods we used to research our objects and the rationale behind that decision. The body of this report reflects on each object and the extent to which it contributed to our overall argument. 
			Going through each object in turn, I will discuss why it was chosen, and what we were attempting to say through its inclusion. When relevant, I will discuss objects we did not include in our report and discuss whether their inclusion 
			may have been more effective. Finally, I will reflect on some of the inherent possible biases that our group may have been working under and how this may have impacted our project. I will argue that this does not take away from 
			the legitimacy of our work, however, but rather indicates directions into which future research can develop." 
			</p>
			<hr />
			<li>Literature Review </li>
			<p>
			I don't need exhaustive lists of academic sources here necessarily, but some indication of where your project came from! In other words, while I expect you 
			refer to the course material or some other published/peer-reviewed sources, you can also have work from other sources mixed in. For instance, if you were working on how 
			gossip magazines construct regressive female narratives using film-stars, you could provide a number of small excerpts from those magazines that 
			provide the context to your project. At the same time, however, on the same topic, you could provide an academic source from a book on Star-systems and how
			magazines are used. I will be totally honest, I will want to see you using academic sources here. Use the library, use google books. 
			</p>

			<hr />
			<li>Methodology</li>
			<p>
			This is going to be quite important in this paper as you will need to tell me what you went through to find each of your objects. What archives did you use? Did they work? Did you just 'google it'? Why? Was it more successful 
			doing it that way? If so, what might that mean? 
			</p>
			<hr />
			<li>Body/Data</li>
			<p>In social sciences, this section would largely be where you would look at what evidence you accrued in as impartial a manner as possible. We don't really 
			work in the same way in the humanities; you should be subtly crafting your report to work towards the claims you made in your introduction.</p>
			<p>
			I would approach this section by going through each object in turn, saying why you included it, saying to what extent you thought its inclusion was successful/impactful, and 
			then - if it makes sense - briefly reflecting on what else maybe could have worked better. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Note! This should be the largest portion of your report by some margin!
			</p>
			<hr />
			<li>Reflection/Evaluation</li>
			<p>
			Again, in the social sciences, this is where you would reflect on your evidence and consider whether or not there were limitations to how you explored what you did, and how they
			may have impacted on your findings. This is very important and shows signs of you thinking on a higher level. While there will be elements of this reflection throughout your paper, 
			here is where you can talk about any assumptions you may have made unconsciously - (by and large, students and staff at Glasgow are 'first-world', 'middle class', university-goers; 
			does this have an impact on how we think? How could this be avoided in future?) 
			</p>
			<hr />
			<li>Conclusion </li>
			<p>This should be super short, but serve to just remind me of what you did in each section, and how it played into what the report was doing. </p>
		</ul>
