	“See here,” Thomas says, in his special library voice – soft but clear. Quiet enough not to stir the library clerk from his midterm slumber. Thomas turns the book he has been reading and pushes it across the table towards me. “This Toland fellow says Christ deliberately chose his disciples from the ignorant classes. Do you see?” He traces his finger along the relevant passage. Thomas can read upside down, no matter how small the print. 
I counter this idea with ease. “Was that not to show that his message was for all men? The humblest as well as the greatest?” 
Thomas shakes his head with a smile and pulls the book back to his side of the table. “That’s a pretty turn to put on the story. What Toland says, and he may have a point, is that those Christ chose were blockheaded fellows, and more easily gulled. Think about it, Mungo. When my poor old pa and I were out selling his worthless cure-alls, it wasn’t the philosophers who were queuing up to buy them. Oh no. If you want an audience for nonsense you must pick one that has no schooling.” He pushes the book towards me again. “Read for yourself. Tell me what you think.” 
So I read. <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fHhOAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false" style="color:red;font-family:arial;text-decoration:none;">Toland's book</a> is notorious. It has been condemned by clergy, and copies burned by the public hangman in his native town in Ireland. But I am not afraid to look at such works for my faith in the Lord is strong. Know thy enemy. And yet, as I read, and argue, and oppose each contention with evidence from holy scripture, I am conscious of a thrill – a terror – that such thoughts have been thought, and committed to paper, and are now dancing through the summer air in this bright room. Toland’s notions appal me with their cruel logic. The world tilts and trembles, as if its very foundations are an illusion. An idea once thought cannot be unthought. The book slides to and fro across the table between us, its cloth binding hissing against the oak with each exchange.
