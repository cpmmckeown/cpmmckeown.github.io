	“Just the one,” she says. “The other lassie is Elizabeth Edmonstone, the Laird of Duntreath’s daughter. She lodges with us, what with the troubles being as they are just now in Stirlingshire.”

	“You’re very lovely,” I say. How can I tell her that what I see is not my slender young bride, but rather a cage made of bones and skin? “It is just that I did not expect... Forgive me, I do not know what I expected.”

The floors are thick with filth, and it would take a rare genius to guess if any flux from her formed part of that cess. Her body is the only evidence we have of what befell her.” Dr Irvine turns and lifts the largest scalpel from the side table. “And on that note, shall we see what story her womb tells us?”
