	<p class="shadow text1">
“We live in a world where piety must be made a show of, as much as penance,” I say.
Frazer looks at me intently. “But do you not think, Mistress Carruth, that the most sincere believer may be the one that bears his faith in the quiet depths of his heart?”

	</p>

<p class="shadow text1">
“The world seems to like evidence.”  

</p>

<p class="shadow text1">
“I make my best efforts to provide that. Divine service as often as they will allow. The reading of worthy literature,” – here he points at a small pile of books set on a low shelf – “to say nothing of loud prayer when I hear footsteps in the corridor.” He leans forward and rests his head in his hands.

</p>

<p class="shadow text1">
“And what about in the quiet depths of your heart?” I say softly. He looks up at me with anguish, and I know then that he is still tortured by doubt. The rigour of the law has quelled his outward acts, but it cannot silence the questions of his mind.
